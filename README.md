Project Description: <br/>
  Wanderlist is a one-sided Tinder for locations. Meaning, it provides users with randomized location from which they can selection a destination. This process is done having a page on which users are shown an image pertaining to a location, they choose whether they wish to save this location or pass on it, and after five saves they user is taken to a page listing out their saved locations. From here they  can make a selection of one location, and are sent to the necessary contact infromation for that location to set up a visit. <br/>
  To ensure a user's selections are  saved, user id's are made with a sign up page, and tracked with a login page. This way, if a user passes on a locaiton, they will not see it again. Furthermore at anytime a user can check what locations they have saved, by goign to the Saved Locations page. <br/>
  Each location is saved as a database entry. The images for the locations are manually taken from Google image search results.
